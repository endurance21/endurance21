<br>
I  like discussing system design, software development, Machine learning and anything that interests me enough  and can be a help to solve real world problems.
<br>

Here are some of my findings and approaches :) 
<br> 
```
# Project 1

# Project-2
  - brief : we all are always on the go to have online meetings and i am sure most of us uses google meet for this purpose, But 
    when you have to setup online meeting , instant meeting lets say, the use flow is like this,  we generally visit the google meet website and click on start instant meeting,
    and then wait for some time,  eventually copy the meeting code and  share.

    I am trying to remove this multistep process into 1 single click event , 
    to save time and productivity being utilized at other places  :)

    Solution1 - The solution would most probably be a chrome browser extension , we can expect to have a button which on being clicked will open a new google meeting into    another tab asychronously and copy the meeting code to the clipboard automatically  with  notification to user when process is complete and meeting is ready to join.


  - status : still brainstroming [open for discussion] 
  - progress :  NIL
  - use-cases : almost every google meet users 
```

# Project 3
  - breif : Ever felt you filled a long form and due to some reason( tab exit or power cut) , all your writting went off , feel so annoying, though many websites have implemented the feature of autosave of forms, but we cannot confront it with every new website we visit and fill long forms to autosave the data in localStorage or so, we should be ensured this at own end , i am finding some solution to this problem
  - status : typio chrome extension (existing solution) , can we make it more good ?
  - progress : NIL
  - use-cases :  to save form data as safety measure to ensure we dont end up writing the same form many times if power cut occurs or so.
```
