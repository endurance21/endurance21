Hey ! 
<br>
My name is Divyanshu Raj,I am  from Bihar, INDIA. 
I love to get involved in discussions that aims to address and device solutions to  real world problems through software technologies >_ .
<br>
I  like discussing system design, software development, Machine learning and anything that interests me enough  and can be a help to solve real world problems.
<br>

Here are some of my findings and approaches :) 
<br> 
```
# Project 1 
  - breif : https://github.com/endurance21/firefly-react
  - status : already built ,up and available  at npm. 
  - progress : recored a cap of 245 downloads per week on npm
  - use-cases :  to brind interactive animation on react websites
```

```
# Project-2
  - brief : we all are always on the go to have online meetings and i am sure most of us uses google meet for this purpose, But 
    when you have to setup online meeting , instant meeting lets say, the use flow is like this,  we generally visit the google meet website and click on start instant meeting,
    and then wait for some time,  eventually copy the meeting code and  share.

    I am trying to remove this multistep process into 1 single click event , 
    to save time and productivity being utilized at other places  :)

    Solution1 - The solution would most probably be a chrome browser extension , we can expect to have a button which on being clicked will open a new google meeting into    another tab asychronously and copy the meeting code to the clipboard automatically  with  notification to user when process is complete and meeting is ready to join.


  - status : still brainstroming [open for discussion] 
  - progress :  NIL
  - use-cases : almost every google meet users 
```
