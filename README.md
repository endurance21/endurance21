HII THERE ! 
<br>
I am trying to build some software solutions with real world applications : )

Project 1  -
breif : [REPOSITORY](https://github.com/endurance21/firefly-react)
status - already built ,up and running at npm. 
progress - recored a cap of 245 downloads per week on npm
use-cases -  to brind interactive animation on react websites


Project-2
brief : we all are always on the go to have online meetings and i am sure most of us uses google meet for this purpose, But 
when you have to setup online meeting , instant meeting lets say, we generally visit the site and click on start instant meeting, and then wait for some time eventually copy the meeting code to share.
I am trying to remove this multistep process into 1 single click event ,  to save time and productivity being utilized at other spaces :)

Solution1 - The solution would most probably be a chrome browser extension , we can expect to have a button which on being clicked will open a new meeting into another tab asychronously and copy the meeting code to the clipboard with  notification to user when process is complete and meeting is ready to join.


status- still brainstroming [open for discussion] 
progress- NIL
use-cases- almost every google meet users
