My name is Divyanshu Raj, from Bihar, INDIA. 
I love to get involved in discussions that aims to address and device solutions to  real world problems through software technologies >_ .
<br>
I  like discussing system design, software development, Machine learning and anything that interests me enough  and can be a help to solve real world problems.
<br>

Here are some of my findings and apporaches :) 
<br> 
```
# Project 1 
  - breif : https://github.com/endurance21/firefly-react
  - status - already built ,up and running at npm. 
  - progress - recored a cap of 245 downloads per week on npm
  - use-cases -  to brind interactive animation on react websites
```

```
# Project-2
  - brief : we all are always on the go to have online meetings and i am sure most of us uses google meet for this purpose, But 
    when you have to setup online meeting , instant meeting lets say, we generally visit the site and click on start instant meeting,
    and then wait for some time eventually copy the meeting code to share.

    I am trying to remove this multistep process into 1 single click event , 
    to save time and productivity being utilized at other spaces :)

    Solution1 - The solution would most probably be a chrome browser extension , we can expect to have a button which on being clicked will open a new meeting into another tab         asychronously and copy the meeting code to the clipboard with  notification to user when process is complete and meeting is ready to join.


  - status- still brainstroming [open for discussion] 
  - progress- NIL
  - use-cases- almost every google meet users 
```
